AI chatbot assistant using tf2.x

Haven't decided the model yet, probably go with fine-tuning transformerXL.
We have some tf1.x preedition, but very immature.
This differs from tradional chatbot,in the way it intends to have emotional support.
ie. -My stomache aches. -Drink more water(traditional bot) -I'm on my way(meaning I understand how you feel and will come to support u.)
We are tring to build it to understand, maybe not to give the best answer, cause mistakes are ok.
Consistency, Understand, Emotional Support.

We're hoping to build a chatbot that feels like girl/boyfriend, maybe oneday AI assistant, Operation System, even Life3.0.
