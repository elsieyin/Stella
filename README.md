AI chatbot assistant using tf2.x

Haven't decided the model yet, probably go with fine-tuning transformerXL.
We have some tf1.x preedition, but very immature.

We're hoping to build a chatbot that feels like girl/boyfriend, maybe oneday AI assistant, Operation System, even Life3.0.

basic small talks. Morning Nights hugs. Focus on emotion support
